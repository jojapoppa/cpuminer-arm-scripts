(create blank img)
dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/usb/gold.img bs=1024k seek=7500 count=0
(7.5Gig)

(give it a dos partition table)
parted /media/usb/gold.img mklabel msdos

(mount it as a loopback device)
losetup -f /media/usb/gold.img
losetup -a

(you will see in the list... so check it - whatever # it is...)
fdisk /dev/loop1
(the command is p, to look at it)

then create partitions
type: n
if your sector size above was 512, and the offset to partition 1 is 2048...
then if you want partition 1 to be around 250M
250000000 / 512 = 488281 + 2048 = 490329.25
so use 490329 as your last partiion.

type: a
(to make partition 1 bootable

then 'n' again to create a partition for the rest...
then 'w' to save it

etc...
